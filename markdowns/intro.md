# Swapping languages in CodinGame

___... a.k.a. 'how to use system() calls?'___

This `Tech.io` playground explores how to use a coding language within another language in the context of [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/) puzzles.

## Sample puzzle

In this playground I will use my solutions in different languages for a CG community solo puzzle called [Rubik](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/rubik%C2%AE) as an example. This is one of the simplest and shortest puzzle on CG. It is more an elementary school math question than a coding puzzle. Still, if you don't like spoilers, go and solve it on your own __before__ going to the next page on this playground.

## Contributions welcome

As you will see, this playground is far from complete. For some languages I couldn't figure out the proper syntax yet.
If you have suggestions for improvements, please:

* send me ([TBali](https://www.codingame.com/profile/08e6e13d9f7cad047d86ec4d10c777500155033)) a __private message__ on CodinGame;
* give a __pull request__ directly to the [github repo](https://github.com/tbali0524/playground-jcb5vasr) of this playground;
* or just leave a comment here.

Regarding **attributions**: some of the ideas here I found on CG forum posts by. Many command line arguments are taken from a code by _Westicles_ (a.k.a. _Mrs.GloriaZindlebocker_).
